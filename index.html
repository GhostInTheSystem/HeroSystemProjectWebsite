                <p>What is Hero System, you ask? It is the RPG that devotes itself to giving players the ultimate versatility. That means it's complicated. Very complicated. That's where my project comes in. While players still have to make the complicated decisions, they will be able to avoid situations of having to calculate ((baseCost+modifierTotal)*(1+advantageTotal))/(1+limitationTotal) for each of their traits, skills, and powers. Think of it as a quality of life program. <br> <br>
                Now, this project is currently still in development. However, you can view the current source code for the project at any time by clicking the button below <br> <br>
